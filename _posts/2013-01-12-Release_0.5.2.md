Razor-qt 0.5.2 is out!
----------------------

This is the second maintenance release of the 0.5 series.

Thanks to the great work of our translators, this release features full translations into over 20 languages.

In addition, a number of improvements and bug fixes were made:

* First day of week will also be detected correctly on systems with Qt older than 4.8.
* Mount plugin received a number of improvements. It will now display volume sizes correctly.
* Razor can now use systemd directly to shutdown/supend/etc.
* Themes were improved to work well with dark Qt color schemes.
* The bug that caused creation of ~/razor and ~/.razor directories was fixed. (If you have such directories, it's safe to delete them)
* And lots of other minor fixes
