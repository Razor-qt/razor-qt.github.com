Razor-qt 0.5.0 is out!
----------------------

The Razor-qt team is proud to release version 0.5.0. It is the culmination of all our efforts since our last release in February of 2012.

There have been several improvements and added features for 0.5.0, as noted in the [Change Log](https://github.com/Razor-qt/razor-qt/wiki/Change-log), but the most noticable are:

* New Appearance GUI for configuring themes
* Several new plugins for added functionality
* Many bug fixes resulting in better performance
* New Notification daemon

The Razor-qt team would like to thank it's staff of 8 members for all the hard work, and the community as well, for all the support. A list of the Razor-qt development team is available [here](https://github.com/Razor-qt?tab=members%20target=), on github.
